## Forward uncertainty quantification analysis

Forward uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis is an effective way to quantify the model prediction uncertainty induced by the input data variations, which serves as a crucial step towards robust decision-making. 

In the notebook, I will demonstrate how to perform forward UQ analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. We will go through three key steps of a typical forward UQ analysis: random sample generation, uncertainty propagation, and uncertainty visualization.
